Welcome to Cubby Stuffers, <%= @user.first_name.capitalize %>!

As you may already know, this project has been a long time coming for us.  We
are truly excited for what lies ahead and are thankful you chose to join us on
this journey they call cubby-stuffing/life.

To show our appreciation, we would like to offer you this super exlusive,
one-time only, never-before-seen offer!

If you would like to enroll in our first trial of cubby stuffing, we would love
for you to click on the link below.  By clicking this link, you will be agreeing
to a 6-week snack subscription for the 1608 module.  For the price of $20
(compared to the usual 30), you will receive snacks in your cubby every Sunday
for the entire module!

Over the next few weeks, we are hoping to tie up a few loose ends in terms of
charges so this one will be on the honor system.  We are hoping this first
run through will be a great opportunity for us to work on logistics while still
being able to provide you and your peers with delicious snacks on a weekly
basis.

If you want to join the internation phenomenon that's ALREADY bigger than Hamilton,
La Croix, and the Harlem Shake put together, just click the link below!

Thank you so much for joining the Cubby Stuffers movement.  We look forward to
feeding you (indirectly, of course).

Your Good Friends,
Charlie and Brian (aka Brain aka Bran aka Bran of House Sayler, first of his name)
